An Affymetrix yeast genome microarray from around 2008, such as the Yeast Genome 2.0 Array, typically contains:

5â€“11 probes per probeset: Each probeset is designed to detect a specific gene or transcript and consists of multiple probes.

About 9,335 probesets: As you noticed, this corresponds to the number of rows in your dataset.

Around 106,000 individual probes: Since each probeset has multiple probes, the total number of probes on the array is much larger than the number of probesets.

These arrays were designed to cover both Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S288C) and Saccharomyces bayanus genomes, which could also contribute to a higher probeset count than the ~6,000 genes in a single yeast species.
