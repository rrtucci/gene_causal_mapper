ChatGPT:

When a study mentions **"two biological replicates per sample"** in the context of an **Affymetrix yeast microarray**, it typically means that for each condition or sample, **two independent biological samples** were grown, processed, and hybridized separately onto the microarrays.

### What This Means for Expression Levels:
1. **Independent Samples**: The two biological replicates originate from separate yeast cultures rather than being technical duplicates of the same RNA extract.
2. **Separate Hybridizations**: Each replicate is processed and hybridized independently on its own microarray chip.
3. **Reported Expression Levels**:
   - If the study reports a single expression value per gene, it is **likely an average (or median) of the two biological replicates**.
   - Sometimes, individual replicate values are reported separately, and statistical methods (e.g., differential expression analysis) use both values to assess variation.

### Difference from Technical Replicates:
- **Biological replicates** capture natural biological variation.
- **Technical replicates** (e.g., multiple measurements from the same RNA extract) account for variability due to technical factors (e.g., hybridization efficiency, scanner noise).
